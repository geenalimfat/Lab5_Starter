## Check Your Understanding
1. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application since unit tests will provide that validate that the feature is working properly. In this case, unit tests can assure that the messages are being sent and received by both parties as well as assuring the complete message is sent in the format that is intended to and the way the sender would want.
2. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature on a messaging application since it is a form of validation that the message is not permitted in exceeding the length and message length is enforced. By writing unit tests, developers can assure that users are not allowed and are notified that they have exceeded the length and message will not be sent if user does in fact want to exceed the length.
